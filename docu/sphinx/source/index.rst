************************************
Igor Pro Universal Testing Framework
************************************

This package empowers a programmer to utilize unit testing for Igor Pro
procedures and XOPs. If you do not yet know about unit tests, start by reading
the introduction on :ref:`introduction`.

There is a :ref:`tour` that will get you started on-the-fly. If you prefer,
you can skip to read about :ref:`basic` or :ref:`advanced`. Some may also find
it useful to skip directly to the :ref:`examples`.
